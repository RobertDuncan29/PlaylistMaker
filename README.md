# PlaylistMaker
This project is my own rendition of a type of playlist maker within c++. This project was for my end of term project for my Data Structures class
in the Fall semester of 2022. My goal for this project was to take the various bits of information such as Stacks, Queues, LinkedLists, as well as
a different rendition of the string class called MyClass. It was my hope to bring this all together, and with the presented data such as the 
band names, albums and songs, allow the user to make a sort of playlist with the given data. This project does not play audio as it was outside
the scope of my class and my original thoughts for this project. This code certainly still has some flaws and thigns that could be fixed in order
to optimize it further.
